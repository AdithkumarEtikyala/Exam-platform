/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for CampusExaminer application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and exam creation,
 * and restricts access to student exam records based on student ID. It allows
 * authenticated users to read exam data, as specific filtering is handled client-side.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /exams/{examId}: Stores exam data. Authenticated users can read/list. Writes are restricted to faculty.
 * - /studentExams/{studentExamId}: Stores student exam records. Students can only create/update their own records before grading. Faculty can list and grade all records.
